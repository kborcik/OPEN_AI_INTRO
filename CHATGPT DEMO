//   ])

//step 1: in a the root folder of your project run npm i open ai.


//step 2: You now need an authentication key. this is a secret. Eventually save this in a .env file that is not client facing. 
// with your key someone could run the possibility of an expensive tab. Navigate to to this link https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
// make an account with open ai if you don't have one already. make a new key.


//step 3: create a .env file in your root directory. Start by running npm i dotenv on your root directory. then create a .env file.
// open that file and include this code. "SERVER_PORT=4000" and set this code equal to your new api key "OPENAI_API_KEY"
//it should look like this:
// 
// SERVER_PORT=4000

//OPENAI_API_KEY=thisisyourecretopenaikeypastedhere



//step4: Lets run a test. Copy the following code into your terminal.
//  curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
//   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
//   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
//   -d '{
//      "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
//      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
//      "temperature": 0.7
//    }'
//
// Before running that code replace $OPENAI_API_KEY with your own personal key. and run the command.
// you should get a message back where the begining looks very similar. however inside the 'choices' object portion under 
// the 'content' key you should see the value to be a string answering your question/ request!!!

// Congratulations you made your first request to the AI!!!!
